dJango_bootcamp_restframework


**Attending Bootcamp:** I am currently attending a bootcamp for a Django developer role in Python.

**REST API Creation:** I have created a REST framework API as part of my project.

**Handling Zip Files:** I updated the code to handle zip files, allowing the upload and extraction of files.

**Attaching Videos:** These zip files include video files that are attached and processed.

**MySQL Connection:** I have connected the application to a MySQL database for data storage.

**Generating API Data:** The API generates data from the zip files and videos, which is formatted into JSON.

**Storing JSON in MySQL:** The generated JSON data is then stored in the MySQL database.
